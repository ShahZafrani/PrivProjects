# XML Behavior Tree Project
Made while taking CS 4523 (Artificial Intelligence) at Kennesaw State University, this was a project where students were asked to write their own XML Parser and then read in a behavior tree of sorts. The program would then respond to user input using whatever was defined in the behavior tree. 

This was also my first time using Java! ... and git for the most part too
